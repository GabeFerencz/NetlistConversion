At work, we have library and procurement integration support for the Mentor 
Graphics Expedition toolchain, but our layouts are sometimes done in Pads. I 
wrote this script to convert from an exported Allegro netlist to a netlist 
we could import into Pads. It worked well enough for what I needed it to do, 
but I tried to write it so it could possibly be extended in the future.
